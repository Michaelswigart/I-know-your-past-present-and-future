#Work planner 
##this planner can help you keep track of your busy schedule.
The planner can help you with regular hours of your day from 9:00am to 5:00pm, you can save an event in any of the the time blocks for that day, all the time blocks are color coded depending what time of day it is, so let's start with green to show you what's to come, red to tell you what hour your on and grey to show you that time has already passed. In this planer you can scroll donw but not very far, it keeps track of the month and day at the top I do so hope you enjoy this planner and make it a part of your everday life.
